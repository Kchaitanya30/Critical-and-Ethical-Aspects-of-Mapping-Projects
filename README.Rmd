# Critical-and-Ethical-Aspects-of-Mapping-Projects


#### Title: Creating a Thematic Map from Race & Ethnicity Data
#### Assignment Three
#### Submission data: 10-05-2024
#### Description: 
This exercise involves analyzing and visualizing the spatial distribution of the Black or African American population across New York City using thematic mapping techniques. The project emphasizes comparing group differences, employing a quantile classification scheme and an inverted Plasma color ramp to highlight demographic patterns

#### Title: Mapping Race and Housing Market Estimates in NYC
#### Assignment Five

#### Description:
This assignment explores the relationship between the Asian population distribution (Location Quotient, LQ) and housing market investment levels (PCT_INVST) across New York City. Using thematic mapping techniques, the analysis highlights geographic patterns of racial inequality in housing investments, revealing disparities between areas with high Asian population concentrations and investor activity.
Two maps were created:

Map 1 focuses on the Bronx, where regions with low LQ, such as Mount Hope and Morris Heights, show high investment, while clusters like Parkchester with relatively high LQ exhibit low investor activity.
Map 2 extends the analysis across NYC, uncovering high investment in Kings County (e.g., Bushwick North, Stuyvesant Heights) and low investment in high LQ areas of Queens (e.g., Flushing, Elmhurst) and Southern Kings County.
The findings reveal disparities influenced by factors such as zoning, socioeconomic demographics, and neighbourhood infrastructure. Investors prioritize regions with strong infrastructure and development potential, often overlooking areas with dense Asian populations. This analysis underscores the need for targeted strategies to address investment gaps and promote equitable housing opportunities.

#### Title: Bivariate Thematic Mapping of Asian Population Percentage and Estimated Median List Price in NYC

#### Assignment Six
#### Description:
This Exercise examines the relationship between the Asian population percentage and estimated median list prices across New York City's census tracts, with a focus on Queens. Using a 4x4 bivariate thematic map, the analysis explores how property listing prices vary in relation to the concentration of the Asian population, revealing trends that may indicate spatial patterns and housing market dynamics in the region. The findings highlight the impact of demographic changes on housing prices, with significant observations in neighborhoods like Flushing, Bayside, and Elmhurst, where higher Asian population percentages are correlated with rising property values.

#### Title: Spatial Analysis of NYC Property Market: Median Sale and List Price Outliers

#### Description:
This bivariate 4x4 map of New York City highlights the relationship between the estimated median sale price and estimated median list price for properties, depicted using a gradient of pink (sale price) and blue (list price). Census tracts are color-coded based on this relationship, while yellow and green dots mark "Possible Outliers" and "Probable Outliers" respectively, indicating areas with unusually high or low property prices. The map reveals a spatial correlation between estimated median sale and list prices, with potential pricing outliers concentrated in Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, suggesting these areas might have irregular property market behaviors compared to the broader NYC trends.

#### Title: Bivariate Map of Black Population Density and Encampment Call Density in North Kings County, NYC

#### Description: 
This bivariate map highlights the spatial patterns between Black population density and encampment call density across neighborhoods in North Kings County, NYC. Clusters like Stuyvesant Heights, Crown Heights North, and Bedford exhibit significant overlap of high Black population density and encampment calls, reflecting patterns of racial segregation. Other neighborhoods, such as Brooklyn Heights and East Williamsburg, show high encampment density despite low Black population density, suggesting influences like gentrification and economic proximity to Manhattan.
